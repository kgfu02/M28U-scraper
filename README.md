# M28U-scraper
Simple web scraper I made for myself that emails you if M28U monitors are in stock. Credits to https://stackoverflow.com/a/40942045 for emailservice.py
Things needed for setup(besides downloading repo files):
1. Follow https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python to setup email api.
2. Rename the .json file you get from step 1 to credentials.json and put in same dir.
